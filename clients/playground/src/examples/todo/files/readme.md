# Kaset Playground â€” Todos

Welcome to a really weird todo app!

It lives in plain Markdown files, but it also has a secret: an agent that can mess with your todos right alongside you.

## âœ¨ What's going on here?

> Kaset [kaËˆset] is an open source toolkit for building browser-first, agent-powered apps.
>
> Drop coding agents straight into your app and let them play alongside your users.

## ðŸ“‚ How it's set up

```
todos/ â†’ your lists live here as .md files.

- [ ] means not done
- [x] means donezo

agents.md â†’ rules the agent follows.

Humans can ignore it. Agents obey. Mostly.
```

## ðŸš€ Try it, break it, bend it

This isn't about a perfect todo app. It's about poking at the edges of what's possible when you let users and agents share the same playground.
