# Kaset Playground 📼

Welcome to **Kaset Playground** — a simple demo showing how **AI agents can safely modify live, running websites** right inside your browser.

## 🌍 What Is It?

Kaset Playground looks like a **tiny desktop inside your browser**. Each app you open (called a _plugin_) is an example of how an AI agent could:

- Add or change parts of a running web page
- Edit files in real time
- Save updates directly in your browser

All of this happens locally — **no servers, no cloud**, just your browser using the **Origin Private File System (OPFS)** for safe storage.

## 🎮 How to Try It

Ask Kas to create a new plugin, edit an existing one, or add features to the live site. For example:

- “Kas, make a new plugin that shows today’s date.”
- “Kas, update the To-Do app to support categories.”

Your changes stay private in your browser, even if you close the page.

## 🧩 Example Plugins

- 📝 **To-Do List** – Shows how an agent could edit a local task file.
- 📂 **File Explorer** – Lets you see what’s stored inside your browser.
- 💬 **Hello Kaset** – A simple example of adding UI to the desktop.

Each plugin is built the same simple way — a manifest and a few lines of JavaScript.

## 🤔 What It Demonstrates

Kaset Playground hows how **AI coding agents** could one day:

- Update live websites safely and instantly
- Build or fix features on the fly
- Interact directly with user-facing code in the browser

> It’s a peek into a world where **websites can learn, adapt, and improve themselves — safely and locally.**
