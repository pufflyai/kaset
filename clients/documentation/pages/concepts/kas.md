# Meet KAS

KAS is Kaset’s in‑browser coding agent. It runs entirely client‑side, using OPFS for a safe, local file sandbox. KAS can search, read, patch, and generate files with user approval.

Jump to the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start) to try set it up.

Jump to the [Playground](https://kaset.dev) to try it out.
