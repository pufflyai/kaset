# Meet KAS

KAS is Kaset’s in‑browser coding agent. It runs entirely client‑side, using OPFS for a safe, local file sandbox. KAS can search, read, patch, and generate files with user approval.

- See [What is Kaset](/getting-started/what-is-kaset) for the big picture.
- Jump to the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start) to try it.
