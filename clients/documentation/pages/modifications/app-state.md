# Application State

Besides [artifacts](/concepts/artifacts), you can also make application state editable by agents. Allow the agent to e.g. navigate across your app on behalf of the user.

Representing app state as files makes it legible to both users and agents. KAS can propose and apply changes via safe, reviewable patches.
