# Introduction

**Kaset** [kaËˆset] is an open source toolkit to add coding agents to your web apps, client side.

::: tip
Kaset is in early development, [join our discussions](https://github.com/pufflyai/kaset/discussions) and help shape it.

## ðŸ¤” Why add coding agents to your app?

Programming has always been a _prelude_: developers write code, ship it, and users consume it.

Now imagine your average user being able to create plugins for your web app on the fly.

No coding experience required.

Directly _inside_ your app.

### Coding agents

Modern coding agents have reached a point where they can meaningfully contribute to a wide variety of tasks, if they are placed in the right environment, with the right project structure.

Kaset brings these agents into the browser and into your application, giving your users the power to edit, mod, and extend it as they see fit.

### Project structure

**The key idea**: if your applicationâ€™s state, configuration, and functionality are broken down into files, then generic coding agents can operate on them naturally.

> With Kaset, the focus shifts from building custom agentic systems for your app, to designing environments where agents can operate effectively.

### This allows you to:

- Treat your application like a moddable game, where agents help users create and share new features.
- Let users extend dashboards, tweak workflows, or build integrations without writing code.
- Ship minimal features and let agents (guided by users) fill in the long tail of custom needs.
